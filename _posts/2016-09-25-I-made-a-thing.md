After a bit of confusion about why an animated "Deal with It" emoticon didn't already exist (I mean really, it's 2016 already)
I used it as an excuse to learn how to gifs work. Turns out all you need to create a gif is patience, source images, and GIMP.

GIMP made the process very easy, with the only caveat being you need to be sure and either not have transparency in your images
or make sure you set the frame disposal option to to only show the current frame instead of stacking them.

Starting with:

![Smirk face]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/deal_with_it/smirk_face_emoji.png "Smirk face")
![Sunglasses face]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/deal_with_it/smiling-face-with-sunglasses.png "Sunglasses face")


And following [this tutorial](https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Simple_Animations/) I made

![deal with it]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/deal_with_it/deal_with_it.gif "deal with it")

Source .xcf file for reference if you want to play around with timing on the frames
[deal_with_it.xcf]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/deal_with_it/deal_with_it.xcf)
