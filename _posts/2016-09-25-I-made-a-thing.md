After months of confusion about why a "Deal with It" emoticon didn't exist, I decided to create my own.
Turns out all you need to create a gif is patience, source images, and GIMP.

Starting with:

![Smirk face]({{ site.baseurl }}//assets/img/deal_with_it/smirk_face_emoji.png "Smirk face")
![Sunglasses face]({{ site.baseurl }}//assets/img/deal_with_it/smiling-face-with-sunglasses.png "Sunglasses face")


And following [this tutorial](https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Simple_Animations/) I made

![deal with it]({{ site.baseurl }}//assets/img/deal_with_it/deal_with_it.gif "deal with it")

Source .xcf file for reference if you want to play around with timing on the frames
