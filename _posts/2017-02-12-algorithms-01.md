>Informally, an algorithm is any well defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and \\
  produces some value, or set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the \\
  input into the output\\
  Cormen Leiserson Rivest Stein, 2004, p# 5

Algorithms are a any well defined procedure that transforms one thing into another, and are not limited to the domain of computer science.
The process by which you brew beer is technically an algorithm.
