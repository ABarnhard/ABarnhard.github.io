Getting things up and running, I decided to go with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for the plattform.
It seems like the right balance between CRM and something I can easily host on Github.


Using a slightly modified version of [Kiko-plus](https://aweekj.github.io/Kiko-plus/) for the theme.


Paradoxically to this posts title, I'll be backfilling content from my old blog to this one, so despite
it not having existed at the time, all my content is in a single place.
