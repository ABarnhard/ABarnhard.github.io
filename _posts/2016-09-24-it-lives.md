Getting things up and running, I decided to go with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for the plattform.
It seems like the right balance between CRM and something I can easily host on Github.


Using a slightly modified version of [Kiko-plus](https://aweekj.github.io/Kiko-plus/) for the theme.
